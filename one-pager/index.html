<p>This will be a website for me to sell prints of artwork and also
  to show a portfolio of other things I have made but am not necessarily
  trying to sell. This website will be used as a way to sell artwork but also
  as a portfolio to impress potential employers
</p>

<h1>Personas</h1>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Employer</b> - This viewer would be looking at my website after I
  applied for a creative-type job and included the link to my website in my resume as a way to
  showcase my abilities</li><br>

  <li><b>Friend</b> - This viewer would know about the website because I promoted it on
  social media or word of mouth and now they are buying prints of my artwork hopefully</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Art-lover</b> - This viewer would be looking online for posters to decorate their apartment
  with and stumbled across my website. This person would hopefully like my artwork - obviously
  they are interested in art, or else they wouldn't be on a website about art.</li>
