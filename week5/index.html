<p>This will be a website for me to sell prints of artwork and also
  to show a portfolio of other things I have made but am not necessarily
  trying to sell. This website will be used as a way to sell artwork but also
  as a portfolio to impress potential employers

<h1>Personas</h1>

<ul>
  <li><img src="icon1.png" alt="Employer" style="width:169px;height:100px;"></li>
  <li><img src="icon2.png" alt="Employer" style="width:169px;height:100px;"></li>
  <li><img src="icon3.png" alt="Employer" style="width:169px;height:100px;"></li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Employer</b> - This viewer would be looking at my website after I
  applied for a creative-type job and included the link to my website in my resume as a way to
  showcase my abilities.</li><br>

  <li><b>Friend</b> - This viewer would know about my website from seeing me promote it on social media,
  or if they don't really use social media, they probably just heard someone say, "Yo! Did you see Tim's
  art website?? That shit is DOPE!!!!!" and because they are my friend and they pity me for trying to be an
  artist, they probably feel obligated to support me by buying one of my posters.</li>
<br>
  <li><b>Art-lover</b> - This viewer would be searching the internet for artwork to decorate his or her apartment
  with and stumbled across my website. This person would hopefully like my artwork - obviously
  they are interested in art, or else they wouldn't be on a website about art.</li>
