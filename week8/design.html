<p>With Gene Cuisine, you can create genetically modified foods on your own outside of a laboratory! We've streamlined the process to be contained within a single portable unit with a touch screen and two seed pads;
  one for the donor organism seed and another for the recipient organism seed. Each Gene Cuisine Biodesign System has a 1TB harddrive loaded with genetic sequencing for all recorded known fruit and vegetable organisms. Any time the user creates a new genetically modified organism, there is an option to save the DNA sequencing onto the harddrive to expand the database.
  This revolutionary product allows the user to utilize their creativity to design all sorts of fantastical food creations and share it with the world!</p>
