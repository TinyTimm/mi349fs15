      <h2>Understanding DNA</h2>
      <p>DNA is essentially the biological, microscopic code which comprises every living organism. DNA is a <strong>universal language</strong>, which means this genetic code does the same thing for every organism. This characteristic is critical to the success of genetic engineering. When a gene for a desirable trait is taken from one organism and inserted into another, it gives the recipient organism the ability to express that same trait. </p>
      <p>To understand genes, we must first look at chromosomes. Every organism has chromosomes, which are tightly wound structures which exist within the nucleus of cells, which exist within an organism. Strands of DNA exist packaged within these chromosomes. DNA is the double-helix collection of genes. Genes, a segment of DNA, are responsible for individual traits to be expressed by the organism. </p>
      <p>Genetic engineering/modification works by physically removing a gene from one organism and then inserting it into another, giving it the ability to express the trait encoded within that gene. </p>
      <p>Over the last 30 years, the field of genetic engineering has developed rapidly due to the greater understanding of DNA. The term genetic engineering is used to describe the process by which the genetic makeup of an organism can be altered using recombinant DNA technology. This involves the use of laboratory tools to insert, alter, or cut out pieces of DNA that contain one or more genes of interest.</p>
      <p>Developing plant varieties expressing favorable characteristics is the ultimate goal of any plant breeder. With <i>conventional</i> plant breeding, however, there is <b>little or no guarantee</b> of obtaining any particular gene combination from the millions of crosses generated. Undesirable genes can be transferred along with desirable genes; or, while one desirable gene is gained, another is lost because the genes of both parents are mixed together and re-assorted more or less randomly in the offspring. These problems limit the improvements that plant breeders can achieve.</p>
      <p>With <i>Gene Cuisine Biodesign System,</i> we have streamlined this process into a single piece of equipment which allows the user to modify the genetic makeup of whichever organisms you desire. The user must provide one seed of each organism- a seed for the donor organism, and a seed for the recipient organism. Seeds are ideal because they are densely packed with DNA. Our product will allow the common citizen to apply their creativity towards designing thoughtful, innovative (and delicious) new food. With <i>Gene Cuisine Biodesign System,</i> the sky is the limit!</p>

  <p>Genes are molecules of DNA that code for distinct traits or characteristics.  For instance, a particular gene sequence is responsible for the color of a flower or a plant's ability to fight a disease or thrive in an extreme environment.</p>
